# misc-linux-settings
Some hacks I had to adopt to make things work on my Linux System due to some hardware &amp; software limitations.


# fix for vscode opens when opening a folder

`xdg-mime query default inode/directory`

`xdg-mime default pcmanfm.desktop inode/direct`

# fix for keyboard backlights not working in ubuntu

`sudo apt install pommed`
